#BMI Calculator

The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a way of estimating the amount of body fat. It's used in medicine to calculate risk of heart disease.
The formula used for calculation is 
BMI = (weight)/(height*height)

I used java and xml for building this application.
It gives green colour if person is healthy , red if overweight and yellow if person is underweight.

The respective look of app in Pixel 3a is as follows :
